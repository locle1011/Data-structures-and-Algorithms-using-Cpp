# Data structures and Algorithms implementation in C++

## Overview

This project includes some common data structures and algorithms implemented in C++ language. I launch this project to improve my skill in C++ and to gather more knowlegdes about DSA. You can use these as sample codes while learning DSA. If there is something wrong with my codes, you can create a new issues here or contact me through the link on my profile.

Good luck and have fun with DSA.

## Tips and tricks

Except for Sort.h, which is not implemented by generic class, you should include both header file (.h) and source file (.cpp) before compiling, for more explaination you can visit [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1724036/splitting-templated-c-classes-into-hpp-cpp-files-is-it-possible).

When you need to work on multi-files project, you can use Linkers on [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) to link those files. Check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ykb1h17M7rw) out for better explaination.
